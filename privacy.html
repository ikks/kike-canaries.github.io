            by itself or through third parties, there are:
            Cookies; Usage Data; unique device identifiers for advertising

          <p>Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are
            provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific
            explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.<br>Personal
            Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data,
            collected automatically when using this Application.<br>Unless specified
            otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and
            failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application
            to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically
            states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to
            communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the
            functioning of the Service.<br>Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to
            contact the Owner.<br>Any
            use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by
            the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the
            purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to
            any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie
            Policy, if available.</p>
          <p>Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained,
            published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have
            the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="one_line_col">
          <h2 id="place_of_processing">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
          <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
          <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
            unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
            destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out using
            computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures
            and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
            Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of
            persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application
            (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
            external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail
            carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies)
            appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated
            list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
          <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
          <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific
              purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to
              process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
              (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
              following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
              processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
              agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
              thereof;</li>
            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
              public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
              Owner;</li>
            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
              party.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
            legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
            the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
          <h3>Place</h3>
          <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any
            other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br>
            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
            transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find
            out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users
            can check the section containing details about the processing of
            Personal Data.</p>
          <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
            transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
            international organization governed by public international law or set
            up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security
            measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br><br>
            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
            the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
            the information provided in the contact section.</p>
          <h3>Retention time</h3>
          <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected
            for.</p>
          <p>Therefore:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance
              of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until
              such contract has been fully performed.</li>
            <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s
              legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
              purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
              interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this
              document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
            period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long
            as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
            to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
            for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
            Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
            expiration of the retention period.</p>
